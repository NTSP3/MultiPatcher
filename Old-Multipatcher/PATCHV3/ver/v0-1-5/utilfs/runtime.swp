Hi! This file is used as a temporary information swap file between the
programs of MultiPatcher.

This file would look something like this if any program used this file:
01011
etc.
and sometimes like
39011

The values in this file would be written as 1s and 0s, kind of like binary.
1s represent True while 0s represent False. The first 2 characters would
define the program (or function) which wrote it. Additional characters are
program-specific settings.

As you may expect, this file cannot be written to if it is in read-only mode.
Therefore, if nothing can be written to the file, the programs would fail to
communicate with each other.
